        I specialize in building mobile responsive front-end UI applications
        that connect with API’s and other backend technologies. I’m
        passionate about learning new technologies and understand there is
        more than one way to accomplish a task. Though I am most proficient
        in building front-end applications using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and
        React, I am a quick learner and can pick up new tech stacks as
        needed. I believe that being a great developer is not using one
        specific language, but choosing the best tool for the job.
